# Fibonacci-sequence

I used fibbonacci array [0,1] as initial condition, 
then i creat for loop let i = 2 to generate number at position 3 of index 2 array, 
then i < 15 , wherein you can change 15 to your desired value to generate different number of fibonacci numbers,
then to calculate fibonacci numbers, add the two previous fibonacci numbers from the array,
then use console.log(fibonacci); to print the fibonacci numbers
